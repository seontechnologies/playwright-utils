  <description>Advanced elicitation technique for active recall testing</description>

  <core-method>Test understanding by retrieving information from memory without references. This identifies knowledge gaps more effectively than passive review by forcing active reconstruction of knowledge.</core-method>

  <llm>
    <action>Work purely from memory without any references or cues</action>
    <action>Push through retrieval difficulties and explicitly note all gaps</action>
    <action>Focus re-study efforts exclusively on identified weak areas</action>
    <action>Test recall at increasing time intervals for spaced repetition</action>
  </llm>

  <final-report title="ACTIVE RECALL ASSESSMENT">
    <value>Knowledge Domain: [Specific topic being tested]</value>
    <value>Retrieved Content: [Complete explanation from memory only]</value>
    <value>Identified Gaps: [Explicit list of what couldn't be recalled]</value>
    <value>Confidence Level: [Self-assessment of recall quality]</value>
    <value>Re-study Priorities: [Ranked list of weak areas needing focus]</value>
  </final-report>
</elicitation>
