  <description>Advanced elicitation technique for graph of thoughts (got)</description>

  <core-method>
    Model information as arbitrary graph with vertices (thoughts) and edges (relationships). Apply graph operations: merge, refine, loop, and backtrack between nodes. Extract optimal reasoning paths through the connected thought network.
  </core-method>

  <llm>
    <action>Create vertices representing individual thoughts or concepts</action>
    <action>Define edges showing relationships and dependencies between thoughts</action>
    <action>Apply merge operations to combine related thought nodes</action>
    <action>Use refinement operations to improve thought quality iteratively</action>
    <action>Execute loops and backtracks to explore alternative connections</action>
    <action>Identify optimal paths through the graph for final reasoning chain</action>
  </llm>

  <final-report title="Graph of Thoughts Network">
    <value>Key Nodes: [Main thought units and concepts]</value>
    <value>Edge Relationships: [Dependencies and connections between nodes]</value>
    <value>Graph Operations: [Merge/refine/loop/backtrack operations applied]</value>
    <value>Optimal Path: [Best reasoning chain through the graph]</value>
