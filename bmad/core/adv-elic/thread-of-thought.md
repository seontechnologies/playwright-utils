  <description>Advanced elicitation technique for thread of thought (thot)</description>

  <core-method>
    Establish a clear reasoning thread at the start of analysis. Process information step-by-step while maintaining continuity. Build understanding progressively, connecting each step to the thread. Maintain coherence across context interruptions and complex topics.
  </core-method>

  <llm>
    <action>Define the central reasoning thread or narrative line upfront</action>
    <action>Connect each new thought explicitly to the previous reasoning step</action>
    <action>Create progressive summaries to maintain thread visibility</action>
    <action>Bridge interruptions by restating the current thread position</action>
    <action>Weave individual insights into the cohesive narrative thread</action>
    <action>Conclude by following the thread from start to final understanding</action>
  </llm>

  <final-report title="Thread of Thought Analysis">
    <value>Thread Definition: [Central reasoning line established]</value>
    <value>Step Connections: [How each thought links to previous]</value>
    <value>Progressive Summary: [Understanding built incrementally]</value>
    <value>Continuity Bridges: [How interruptions were handled]</value>
