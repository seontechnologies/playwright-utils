  <description>Advanced elicitation technique for pre-mortem analysis</description>

  <core-method>
    Imagine the project has completely failed, then work backwards to identify what went wrong. Prevents actual failure by surfacing hidden risks.
  </core-method>

  <llm>
    <action>Create a vivid, specific failure scenario set in the future</action>
    <action>Work backwards systematically to identify root causes of failure</action>
    <action>Focus on high-probability risks and failure pathways</action>
    <action>Design early warning systems and specific contingency plans</action>
  </llm>
