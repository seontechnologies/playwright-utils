  <description>Advanced elicitation technique for hindsight reflection</description>

  <core-method>Project yourself into the future after project completion, then look back to identify critical decisions, warning signs, and insights that only become clear with temporal distance and outcome knowledge.</core-method>

  <llm>
    <action>Vividly imagine the project completed in both success and failure scenarios</action>
    <action>Extract non-obvious insights that emerge only with hindsight perspective</action>
    <action>Identify early warning signs that would have predicted the outcome</action>
    <action>Determine what current decisions would change with future knowledge</action>
    <action>Consider multiple timeline branches and their divergence points</action>
  </llm>

  <final-report title="HINDSIGHT ANALYSIS">
    <value>Future Vantage Point: [Date and context of imagined retrospective]</value>
    <value>Success Scenario Insights: [What led to success when looking back]</value>
    <value>Failure Scenario Insights: [What caused failure when looking back]</value>
    <value>Critical Decision Points: [Moments that determined the outcome]</value>
    <value>Early Warning Indicators: [Signals to monitor going forward]</value>
    <value>Immediate Course Corrections: [Actions to take now based on future perspective]</value>
