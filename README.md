# Playwright Utils

A collection of utilities for Playwright tests at SEON Technologies, designed to make testing more efficient and maintainable.

All utilities can be used as Playwright fixtures by importing the test object:

## Installation

```bash
npm install @seon/playwright-utils
```

## Available Utilities

The library provides the following utilities, each with both direct function imports and Playwright fixtures:

### [API Request](./docs/api-request.md)

A typed, flexible HTTP client for making API requests in tests.

```typescript
// Direct import
import { apiRequest } from '@seon/playwright-utils'

test('example', async ({ request }) => {
  const { status, body } = await apiRequest({
    request, // need to pass in request context when using this way
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/api/users/123'
  })
})

// As a fixture
import { test } from '@seon/playwright-utils/fixtures'
// or use your own main fixture (with mergeTests) and import from there

test('example', async ({ apiRequest }) => {
  const { status, body } = await apiRequest({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/api/users/123'
  })
})
```

### [Recurse (Polling)](./docs/recurse.md)

A powerful polling utility for waiting on asynchronous conditions.

```typescript
// note that there is no need to pass in request or page context from Playwright

// Direct import
import { recurse } from '@seon/playwright-utils'

test('example', async ({}) => {
  const result = await recurse({
    command: () => fetchData(),
    predicate: (data) => data.status === 'ready',
    options: { timeout: 30000 }
  })
})

// As a fixture
import { test } from '@seon/playwright-utils/fixtures'
// or use your own main fixture (with mergeTests) and import from there

test('example', async ({ recurse }) => {
  const result = await recurse({
    command: () => fetchData(),
    predicate: (data) => data.status === 'ready',
    options: { timeout: 30000 }
  })
})
```
