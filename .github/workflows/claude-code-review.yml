            2. **Playwright Testing Best Practices**
               - Adherence to Playwright best practices (no hard waits, proper async handling)
               - Test reliability and flakiness prevention
               - Proper use of fixtures vs direct functions
               - Parallel test safety

            3. **Library Design**

            4. **Testing Coverage**
               - Verify adequate test coverage for new utilities
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check sample-app integration tests

            5. **Performance & Security**
               - Identify potential performance issues
               - Check for security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization in utilities
