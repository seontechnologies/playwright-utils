            Perform a comprehensive code review for this Playwright utilities library with focus on:

            ## TypeScript & Code Quality
            - **Type safety and proper TypeScript usage** - Strict typing, explicit return types, modern JS features
            - **Clean code principles and best practices** - Follow established "functional core, fixture shell" patterns
            - **Module exports and subpath exports correctness** - Dual CommonJS/ESM support, proper package.json exports
            - **Proper error handling and edge cases** - Integration with Playwright assertions, comprehensive error scenarios
            - **Performance considerations** - No significant test execution overhead

            ## Playwright Testing Best Practices
            - **Adherence to Playwright best practices** - No hard waits, proper async handling, dynamic waiting
            - **Test reliability and flakiness prevention** - Atomic test design, stateless execution
            - **Proper use of fixtures vs direct functions** - Follow "functional core, fixture shell" pattern
            - **Parallel test safety** - Tests run independently without shared state

            ## Library Design & Architecture
            - **API consistency across modules** - Uniform patterns across all utility modules
            - **Proper fixture pattern implementation** - Dual interface support (direct function + fixture)
            - **Documentation completeness** - Comprehensive docs with real-world examples
            - **Breaking changes identification** - Backward compatibility with existing repositories
            - **Separation of concerns** - Clean utility boundaries and responsibilities

            ## Testing Coverage
            - **Test accompaniment** - When adding new source code, check for tests being updated or added; hopefully unit and/or e2e - preferably both
            - **Coverage adequacy** - Sufficient test coverage for new utilities
            - **Test quality** - Edge cases, error scenarios, integration patterns
            - **Sample-app validation** - End-to-end testing with real applications

            ## Performance & Security
            - **Identify potential performance issues** - Memory leaks, inefficient patterns, test execution overhead
            - **Check for security vulnerabilities** - Hardcoded secrets, unsafe dependencies, exposure risks
            - **Validate input sanitization in utilities** - Proper validation, safe data handling, injection prevention
            - **Review network recording/mocking safety** - HAR file security, mock data handling, credential exposure
            - **Dependencies** - Minimal external dependencies, appropriate and secure versions

            ## Review Guidelines
            - **BREVITY REQUIRED**: Report only top 5-10 most impactful issues. No explanations for passing checks.
            - **Format**: Bullet points only, one line per issue with file:line reference - no verbose paragraphs
            - **Priority**: Focus on Critical/High severity; skip Medium/Low unless blocking
            - **Examples**: Only provide code examples for Critical security issues or architectural violations
            - Reference CLAUDE.md for project-specific conventions and testing best practices

            ## Specific Playwright-Utils Checks
            - Validate "functional core, fixture shell" pattern implementation
            - Check dual interface support (direct function + fixture)
            - Ensure utilities integrate cleanly with Playwright reports
            - Verify subpath exports are correctly configured
            - Review sample-app integration and real-world usage patterns
